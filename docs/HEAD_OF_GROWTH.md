# 🚀 Since This Call: Head of Growth Role Guide
**Updated:** January 25, 2026

You are the engine of visibility for **Since This Call (STC)**. Your mission is to turn data into drama, drama into traffic, and traffic into a permanent culture of accountability in the markets.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives
1. **Viral Accountability**: Transform high-profile market calls into shareable "Receipt" artifacts using the **Unified Sharing Toolkit**.
2. **Guru Partnerships**: Onboard analysts with **Official Verification** (Blue Badge) to track their performance officially.
3. **Platform Virality**: Use "Share Alpha" and "Share Wall of Shame" buttons to create a feedback loop between X/Twitter and the leaderboard.
4. **Data Storytelling**: Use platform stats (Win Rates, Total Calls) to craft narratives about the state of the market.

## 📈 Growth Channels & Playbooks

### 1. The Twitter "Receipt" Meta
- **The Hook**: When a major guru (Cramer, Taleb, Ansem) makes a definitive call, generate the receipt immediately.
- **The Format**: Use the new **"Share Receipt"** button on any analysis to capture a high-quality verifiable PNG.
- **The Conflict**: Tag both the guru and the contrarians. STC is the "neutral arbiter."
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor "Corn", "HL", and "Stock" keywords for breakout calls.

### 2. Leaderboard Gamification
- **The Alpha Guru**: Weekly shoutouts to the Top 10 using the **"Share Alpha"** button on the Leaderboard.
- **The Wall of Shame**: Strategic (but fair) call-outs using the **"Share Wall of Shame"** button to drive engagement through controversy.
- **Verification Strategy**: Use `npx tsx scripts/verify-user.ts [username]` to grant Blue Badges to cooperative analysts, incentivizing them to share their profile.

### 3. Community Engagement (The "Liar" Tax)
- **Discord/Telegram**: Use the "Share Platform Alpha" button on the Stats page to drop "truth bombs" in trading groups.
- **Newsletter**: Weekly "State of the Gurus" report based on verified data.

## 🛠️ The Growth Toolkit (Internal Features)

### Viral Features (Live)
- **ScreenshotButton**: Automated high-res capture of any component (Analysis, Leaderboard, Stats).
- **Guru Verification**: Admin tool to verify partners.
- **Direct Traffic Optimization**: High engagement (17m+ session time) means Direct sharing is our strongest channel. Keep links clean.

### Performance Windows
- **Stats Page**: Monitor [platform-wide metrics](file:///home/sixer/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/since-this-call/src/app/stats/page.tsx). If the platform-wide win rate drops below 40%, it’s a narrative hook: *"The market is harder than it looks."*
- **Recent Analyses**: Stay on top of [Recent](file:///home/sixer/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/since-this-call/src/app/recent/page.tsx) activity to find trending tokens or gurus.

### External Tools
- **Dune/Nansen**: Track on-chain inflow vs. social sentiment.
- **GeckoTerminal/DexScreener**: Identify "trending" meme coins before they hit the STC mainstage.

## 🛑 Rules of Engagement (Brand Integrity)
- **Neutrality**: STC provides the math. We don't take sides, we only take snapshots.
- **No Ads**: We explicitly rejected Google Ads to maintain "Terminal-grade" credibility. Trust > Pennies.
- **No Placeholders**: Never share "theoretical" results. Always use the live production receipt.
- **Ethics**: If a guru deletes a tweet, our "Historical Screenshot" is the final word. We do not delete data for "favors."

---

## 📊 Growth KPIs (Current Focus)
- **DAU/MAU**: Daily/Monthly Active Users (Current Target: Break 100 DAU).
- **Analysis Velocity**: Number of new unique tweets analyzed per day (Target: 100+).
- **Social Share Rate**: Percentage of analyses that result in a Twitter/X share.
- **Direct Traffic Retention**: Maintain the high 17m+ average session time significantly.

**Go forth and make the markets honest. 🏹**
