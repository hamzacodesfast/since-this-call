**Updated:** February 28, 2026

You are the architect of accountability for **Since This Call (STC)**. Your mission is to position the platform as the market's "Ledger of Truth"—transforming financial influence into a verifiable performance asset.

## 🎯 Core Objectives
1.  **Weaponize the Receipts**: Use our "Inverse Law of Certainty" data (High Confidence = 100% Fail Rate) to create viral narratives around guru accuracy.
2.  **The "10k to 100k" Funnel**: Convert viral reach into recurring users via the **Blue Badge Verification** program.
3.  **Revenue vs. Integrity**: Deploy the **Merch Store** as a non-conflicting revenue stream ("Wear the Receipt").
4.  **Brand Authority**: Enforce the position: **"The AI Powered Social Prediction Tracker."** We are not just a tool; we are a financial institution.

## 📈 Growth Channels & Playbooks

### 1. The "Viral Arbiter" Meta
*   **The Hook**: When a guru deletes a tweet, our "Historical Screenshot" is the only proof.
*   **The Tactic**: Use the **"Wall of Shame"** button. Data shows Verified Losses are shared **8x more** than wins.

### 2. The Content Machine (Data-Driven)
*   **The Narrative**: "Confidence implies Failure." Use the receipts to prove it.
*   **The Format**: Weekly "State of the Market" reports using automated metrics from `npx tsx scripts/generate-tweets.ts`.

### 3. Community & Direct Traffic
*   **Retention**: High session times thanks to the interactive charts. Keep users exploring via the "Share Alpha" loop on the Leaderboard.

### 4. The Data Moat (Why We Win)
*   **Linguistic Disambiguation**: Unlike competitors, we know that "Corn" = BTC and "Cooked" = Sell. 
*   **Leaderboard Maturity**: We strictly enforce a **20-call minimum** for leaderboard eligibility, ensuring only analysts with a significant track record appear. This builds trust with institutional-grade users.

### 5. The Merch Store (Bootleg E-Commerce Strategy)
Our merch is not generic promotional apparel; it is a premium streetwear brand built on the "Inverse Law of Certainty." The core product: **Heavyweight Bootleg Graphic Tees of the finance world's most infamous characters.**
*   **The "Vintage Drop" Look**: Market the shirts like 90s vintage rap tees. Grainy aesthetics, high-quality 7.5oz max heavyweight cotton. Emphasize that it's "Made to survive a bear market."
*   **The "Reply Guy" Engine**: Leverage the STC Twitter Watcher. When Jim Cramer or Peter Schiff post something disastrous, reply directly with a high-res image of their specific Bootleg Tee and a link. Let the timeline viral-ratio them.
*   **"The Casino" Exclusivity**: Enforce artificial scarcity. Treat characters like rockbands on tour. Rotate characters in and out of the "Vault" to force urgency. Run Twitter polls to let the audience dictate the next character drop.
