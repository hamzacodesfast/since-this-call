## 📈 Growth Channels & Playbooks

### 1. The Twitter "Receipt" Meta
- **The Hook**: When a major guru (Cramer, Taleb, Ansem) makes a definitive call, generate the receipt immediately.
- **The Format**: Use the "Generate Video" or "Capture Receipt" features to post visual proof.
- **The Conflict**: Tag both the guru and the contrarians. STC is the "neutral arbiter" in every market debate.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor "Corn", "HL", and "Stock" keywords for breakout calls.

### 2. Leaderboard Gamification
- **The Alpha Guru**: Weekly shoutouts to the highest-performing analysts on the [Leaderboard](file:///home/sixer/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/since-this-call/src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx).
- **The Wall of Shame**: Strategic (but fair) call-outs of the "Bottom 5" performers to drive engagement through controversy.
- **User Suggestions**: Encourage users to reply with links to tweets they want "receipted."

### 3. Community Engagement (The "Liar" Tax)
- **Discord/Telegram**: Deploy the STC bot to resolve arguments. "Don't argue, check the receipt." 
- **Newsletter**: Weekly "State of the Gurus" report. Who is hot, who is cope, and what the aggregate sentiment says.

## 🛠️ The Growth Toolkit (Internal Features)

### Performance Windows
- **Stats Page**: Monitor [platform-wide metrics](file:///home/sixer/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/since-this-call/src/app/stats/page.tsx). If the platform-wide win rate drops below 40%, it’s a narrative hook: *"The market is harder than it looks."*
- **Recent Analyses**: Stay on top of [Recent](file:///home/sixer/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/since-this-call/src/app/recent/page.tsx) activity to find trending tokens or gurus.

### External Tools
- **Dune/Nansen**: Track on-chain inflow vs. social sentiment.
- **GeckoTerminal/DexScreener**: Identify "trending" meme coins before they hit the STC mainstage.

## 🛑 Rules of Engagement (Brand Integrity)
- **Neutrality**: STC provides the math. We don't take sides, we only take snapshots.
- **No Placeholders**: Never share "theoretical" results. Always use the live production receipt.
- **Ethics**: If a guru deletes a tweet, our "Historical Screenshot" (if available) or archive is the final word. We do not delete data for "favors."

---

## 📊 Growth KPIs
- **DAU/MAU**: Daily/Monthly Active Users checking receipts.
- **Analysis Velocity**: Number of new unique tweets analyzed per day (Target: 100+).
- **Social Share Rate**: Percentage of analyses that result in a Twitter/X share.
- **Retention**: Percentage of users who return to check a specific guru's updated performance.

**Go forth and make the markets honest. 🏹**
